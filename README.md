# Magnetic_Rotating_Setup
This repository documents a rotating magnet setup that uses a stepper motor to precisely control two parallel rotating magnets. The system is designed for applications requiring controlled magnetic torque while minimizing unwanted field gradients.

**Repository Structure**  
The project is divided into three main chapters:

**1. Parts & Assembly** – Component list, STP and SLDASM files of the entire assembly, SLDPRT files of all parts, DXF files for lasercutting, STL files for 3D printing.  
**2. Electronics** – Introduction to the electronic componets used, wiring diagram, Arduino code, Nextion communication protocol, Nextion code.  
**3. Magnets** – Field-shaping algorithm.
